# Small Invisible Machines

Professional contact and resume website for me, Daniel A. Anderson.

## Objective

Build a single-page, progressive web application that has top-notch SEO and UX.

We could use lots of tools to do this for us—Gatsby, Wordpress, etc.—but instead we'll demonstrate rolling our own.

We do design treatments for multiple screen sizes and orientations.
